### Git commit messages
In order to make the commit messages as readable and informative in possible, its important to keep them as concise as possible (:

To do this, its pretty helpul to structure your commit messages like this


#### Commit Message:
This is the main context for the message, this needs as much clarity and simplity as possible. A good way to write this is to structure as "COMMIT TYPE: CHANGE OVERVIEW". The main three commit types we will need are as follows:
-     - FEAT - This is any new feature added to the project such as a new script or asset.
-     - FIX - If something has been fixed or is an in-progress fix.
-     - MISC - Miscellaneous commits such as changing project files or the file structures.

This will then look something like this:
-     - EXAMPLE 1 "FEAT: Created player controller"
-     - EXAMPLE 2 "FIX: Added missing project files"
-     - EXAMPLE 3 "MISC: Updated art file structure"

#### Description: 
This is where you can thene expand your commit to further explain any changes, issues, or even what you need to do next if this commit is still a work in progress. These descriptions can be less formal and can be as long or short as you want. I tend to write notes for myself or add resources which i may be using to help me solve a problem so i can easily reference them for later etc
